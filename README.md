## Features

- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Implements JWT-based authentication to keep your data and users safe.
- üìÑ **Client Requirement Processing**: Accepts client requirements through PDFs and tech stack preferences, storing PDFs securely in Cloudinary.
- üìä **Requirement Breakdown Generation**: Automatically generates functional, non-functional, and feature breakdowns, storing and retrieving them from the database.
- üèó **Tech Stack Recommendation**: AI-driven recommendations for the most suitable tech stack, stored and fetched from the database.
- üèõ **Architecture Diagram Generation**: Generates architecture diagrams dynamically, storing and retrieving them from the database.
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Business Analyst**: Generates and stores business analysis reports, making them available for retrieval as needed.
- ‚è≥ **AI-Powered Effort Estimation**: Uses AI to estimate effort, generates an Excel file, and securely stores it in Cloudinary.
- üñº **AI-Powered Wireframe Generation**: Generates wireframes using AI, storing images securely in the database.
- üîë **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implements role-based access to restrict or grant features based on user roles.
- üïí **Version Control**: Uses `mongoose-history-plugin` to maintain version control for stored data, ensuring data integrity and tracking changes over time.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for building the backend.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for handling API requests and routing.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for flexible, scalable data storage.
- **Cloudinary**: For cloud-based storage and management of media files.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Secure and stateless authentication system.
- **Docker**: For containerization, making it easy to deploy and scale.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following configuration:

```env
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=8080

CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUD_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUD_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=expiration_time_in_seconds

BACKEND_URL=url_of_ai_server_from_https://github.com/fatima-amani/ai-powered-presales-automation-ai
```

### Replace the placeholders:

- **MONGO_URL**: Your MongoDB connection string (e.g., `mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname`).
- **CLOUD_NAME, CLOUD_API_KEY, CLOUD_API_SECRET**: Your Cloudinary credentials for media storage.
- **JWT_SECRET**: A secure key used for JWT authentication.
- **JWT_EXPIRES_IN**: Token expiration time in seconds (e.g., `3600` for 1 hour).
- **BACKEND_URL**: The URL of the AI server from [this repository](https://github.com/fatima-amani/ai-powered-presales-automation-ai).

> üö® **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Be sure to add it to your `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

### Start the Development Server

To run the server locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: `8080`). You can access it at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Run with Docker

To run the project inside a Docker container, first build the image and then run it with:

```bash
docker build -t ai-presales-backend .
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env ai-presales-backend
```
